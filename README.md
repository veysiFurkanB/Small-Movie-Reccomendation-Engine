# Small-Movie-Reccomendation-Engine
Basic movie reccomendation using euclidean or pearson similarity.

This program has three different data folder that needs to be uploaded inorder to get some close reccomendations and set the data bases for the movies.

There are two different reccomendation opportunity, according to the user or according to the movie. The first columns shows the ids of the eighter movies or users. Second columns shows the similarity/reccomendation results and the final column shows the detailed information about the selected movie.

I used IMDB API to fetch the information about the selected movies.

This project was educational purposes.
